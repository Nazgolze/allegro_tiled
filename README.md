allegro\_tiled
==============

allegro\_tiled is an [Allegro 5](http://alleg.sourceforge.net/) module that adds support for parsing and using [TMX](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format) map files. This means that [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org), as well as any other program supporting the same map format, can be used to create and edit game worlds while the complexity of parsing and drawing them is completely taken care of:

```c
ALLEGRO_MAP *map = al_open_map("data/maps", "level1.tmx");
al_draw_map(map, 0, 0, 0); // (map, dx, dy, flags)
```

Additional methods are provided to draw one map layer at a time and/or draw only a particular section. Layers, tilesets, tiles, and objects are all given types, with methods that make them easy to access and use.

Currently, the following is supported:

1. Orthogonal maps.
2. Base64 encoding with gzip, zlib, or no compression.
3. XML and CSV encoding. (though honestly, why would you?)
4. Tile "flipped" flags, both vertically and horizontally.
5. Objects.

The following is not yet supported:

1. Isometric maps.

Compiling the Library
=====================

Dependencies in Linux:
----------------------

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

 * allegro
 * allegro\_image
 * xml2
 * zlib
 * cmake

Dependencies in OSX:
--------------------

Make sure the following dependencies are installed using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

 * allegro5
 * libxml2
 * zlib
 * cmake

Compiling:
----------

Then simply run `cmake .` followed by `make` in the root folder to compile it, and optionally `sudo make install` to handle installation. To run the example, cd to the examples folder and type `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.. ./example`. Use the arrow keys to scroll and Space to reload the map file.

If you wish to disable building the example, simply run cmake with `-DWANT_EXAMPLE=Off` before building the library.

CMake will configure the build for a static library by default. If you would like to build a shared library instead, add `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS` to the cmake command above.

On Other Platorms:
------------------

This should work just fine on Windows and possibly FreeBSD, provided you know how to use CMake for those platforms and have the proper dependencies installed. However, because I primarily develop on Linux, I don't test on those platforms. Bug reports and fixes are welcome.
